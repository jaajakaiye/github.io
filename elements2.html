										<h2 id="content">Data of Description:</h2>
										<p><font size="3.5"> The data is from the <strong>California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP)</strong> in the California Department of Public Health.
										The primary purpose of the CSCP is to collect information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients
										in cosmetic products sold in California and make this information available to the public.</font></p>
										<p><font size="3.5">Consumer and worker advocacy groups are concerned because some cosmetic products contain chemicals known 
										or suspected to cause cancer, congenital disabilities, or damage to the reproductive system.</font></p>
										<p><font size="3.5"><strong>The California Safe Cosmetics Act (“the Act”)</strong> was signed into law in 2005. For all cosmetic products
										sold in California, the Act requires the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the CSCP
										a list of all cosmetic products; that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other
										developmental or reproductive harm.</font></p>
										
										<p><font size="3.5"> Some ingredients reported to the CSCP as <strong>“trade secret.”</strong> If "trade secret" is listed as an ingredient for a 
										product on this website, it means that one or more ingredients are known or suspected to cause cancer, congenital disabilities, or other
										developmental or reproductive harm. The reporting company has elected to designate the information as a "trade secret."</font></p>
										
										<p><font size="3.5">For more information and resources, see the CSCP webpage online

								        <h2>Sample</h2>
            									
            									<p><font size="3.5">With the dataset I acquired, I collected a sample of the data by analyzing the chemicals used in the Cosmetic Brands. There
												are <strong> 6 Chemical Names, 202 Chemicals, 19 Cosmetic Brands, 11 Companies, & 199 Case Ids.</strong> The picture below shows the names of the 6 Chemicals in Cosmetic Brands.</font></p>
												
												<span class="image main"><img src="images/chemicalnames.png" style="width:1000px;height:450px;"></span></a>
												
												<p><font size="3.5">The top 3 companies with the most Chemicals in their Cosmetic Brands are McConnell Labs. Inc, OPI Products Inc., & Clarins S.A. The picture below illustrates
												the number of Chemicals in the 11 companies. These companies have a vast number of 6 Chemicals in the Cosmetic Brands they sell in the market from the image above. </font></p>
												
												<span class="image main"><img src="images/ccbs.png" style="width:1000px;height:450px;"></span></a>
												
												<p><font size="3.5">In 2009, there were 178 chemicals created, and in 2010 there were 21. The manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor updated the chemicals in 2009 and 2010, with an   
												additional year in 2012. The images below illustrate the timeline of the year chemicals were created and updated.</font></p>

											 	<p><font size="3.5">The image below shows the primary categories with the number of chemicals sold in Cosmetic products. Nail Products have a higher percentage of 82.7% known or  
											 	 suspected chemicals to cause cancer, congenital disabilities, or damage to the reproductive system.</font></p>						 
											
												<span class="image main"><img src="images/chemicalprimary2.png" style="width:1000px;height:450px;"></span></a>
												
																								
												<p><font size="3.5">The number of chemicals in these cosmetic products is very alarming. I believe each state in the United States should have the Safe Cosmetics Act passed, so the public would 
												be informed of these chemicals' potential, causing cancer, congenital disabilities, or damage to the reproductive system.</font></p> 
												
												<p><font size="3.5">Interestingly, those who work with cosmetics - including barbers, hairstylists, skincare, body care, and nail salon workers - may be more vulnerable to these products' adverse 
												 health effects because they handle more significant quantities of cosmetics with greater frequency.</font></p>
