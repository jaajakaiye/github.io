									<h3 id="content">Data of Description:</h3>
									
									<p><font size="3.5"> Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) and the City of Pittsburgh both publish their
									data through the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data
									Center supports key community initiatives by making public information easier to find and use. The
									Data Center maintains Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh's open data portal and provides
									several services to data publishers and users. The Data Center also hosts datasets from these public 
									sector agencies, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations. The Data Center is managed by 
									the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Social and Urban Research and is a partnership of the University,
									Allegheny County, and Pittsburgh's CIty.</font></p>
									<p><font size="3.5">Metadata Updated: November 30, 2020
                                    					This data shows healthcare utilization for asthma by Allegheny County residents 18 years of age and younger.
                                   					 It counts asthma-related visits to the Emergency Department (ED), hospitalizations, urgent care visits, and 
                                    					asthma controller medication dispensing events.</font></p> 
									<p><font size="3.5">The asthma data was compiled as part of the Allegheny County Health Department's Asthma
									Task Force, established in 2018. The Task Force was formed to identify strategies to decrease asthma inpatient
									and emergency utilization among children (ages 0-18), focusing on children receiving services funded by Medicaid. 
									Data is being used to improve the understanding of asthma in Allegheny County and inform the task force's recommended 
									actions. This data will also be used to evaluate progress toward reducing asthma-related hospitalization and ED visits.
									The Allegheny County Health Department's Asthma Task Force criteria of asthma utilization are: 
									<ul>
									<li>at least 1 ED visit (dx 1-10 J45.xxx)</li>
									<li>at least 1 acute inpatient encounter (dx 1-10 J45.xxx)</li>
									<li>at least 1 outpatient visit or observational stay (dx 1-10 J45.xxx)</li>
									<li>at least 1 asthma controller medication dispensing event</li> 
									</ul>
									</font></p>
									<p><font size="3.5">Regarding this data, we defined asthma using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
									Revision <a href="https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#/J40-J47" target="_blank">(IDC-10) classification system code J45.xxx.</a> 
									The ICD-10 system classifies diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures in the U.S. healthcare system.</font></p>
									<p><font size="3.5">Children seeking care for an asthma-related claim in 2017 are represented in the data. The Health Department
									compiles data from medical claims submitted to three health plans (UPMC, Gateway Health, and Highmark). Claims may also come
									from people enrolled in Medicaid plans managed by these insurers. The Health Department estimates that 74% of the Countyâ€™s
									population aged 0-18 is represented in the data.</font></p>   
									<p><font size="3.5">Users should be cautious of using administrative claims data to measure disease prevalence and interpret
									trends over time. Missing from the data are the uninsured, members in participating plans enrolled for less than 90 continuous
									days in 2017, children with an asthma-related condition that did not file a claim in 2017, and children participating in plans
									managed by insurers who have not shared data with the Health Department.</font></p>   
									<p><font size="3.5">Data users should also be aware that diagnoses may also be subject to misclassification and that children
									with an asthmatic condition may not be diagnosed. It is also possible that some children may be counted more than once in the
									data if they are enrolled in a plan by more than one participating insurer and file a claim on each policy in the same calendar year.</font></p>

                                    <p><font size="3.5">Based on the data, there should be a trend to analyze the number of children with asthma utilization who 
                                    meet the criteria of visiting the ED, hospitalization to the ED, or visiting an Urgent Care. As stated before, this data will be  
                                    used to evaluate progress toward reducing asthma-related hospitalization and ED visits.</font></p>
