										<h2>Project 2</h2>
									</header>
									<p><font size="3.5"> The basis for this project is, <strong>"would a student's SAT score determines their graduating GPA in College."</strong> The data 
									analysis in this project would explain this outcome. I used the Linear Regression analysis because it's a linear approximation of a casual relationship between two
									or more variables. Linear Regression is probably the most fundamental machine learning method out there and starting point for the advanced analytical
									learning path. This method would predict GPA based on the SAT scores obtained from student's standardized testing.</font></p>
									<p><font size="3.5"> SAT is known as "standardized testing" students sit for as Seniors in High School to apply to Universities in the United States. It measures 
									the student's ability in Mathematics, Critical Reading, and Writing. The higher the score, the higher the chance the student would be admitted to their top
									choice University. The SAT is based on <strong> a 1600*-point scale</strong>; there is no penalty for wrong answers, so the raw score is the sum of the number 
									of questions you answer correctly.</font></p> 
									
									<p><font size="3.5"> *In March 2016, the SAT underwent a massive redesign, part of which included a change to its scoring system: it shifted from a 2400-point 
									scale to a 1600-point scale.</font></p>
									
									
									<p><font size="3.5">GPA is known as "grade point average," which indicates how well or high students scored in their courses on average. Usually, the GPA 
									scale is between <strong> "1.0 to 4.0"</strong> and shows the level of success during their four years in college.</font></p>
									
									<p><font size="3.5">The process applying to Universities begins with the following:
									<li>Sit for SAT</li>
									<li>Get SAT score</li>
									<li>Apply to University</li>
									<li>Attend University</li>
									<li>Graduate with GPA</li></font></p>
									
									<p><font size="3.5">As I stated before,"would a student's SAT score determines their graduating GPA in College;" why would I predict GPA with SAT? The reason is SAT
									is considered one of the best estimators of intellectual capacity and capability. Almost all colleges across the USA are using the SAT as a proxy for admission.
									The SAT has stood the test of time since it was debut in 1926 and administered by the College Board.</font></p>

                                    <p><font size="3.5">Since the coeifficient for the SAT is 0.0017, and the constant is 0.2750. The Linear Regression equation provides the answer to predict 
                                    a student's score from the SAT to GPA results. For these assumption to be accurate, let's denote SAT scores with the equation and analyze 
                                    if the outcome is similar to the top 15 scores from the picture above.</font></p> 
                                    
                                    <p><font size="3.5">The equation from the OLS summary is ŷ= 0.0017*x1 + 0.275. If students received between 1650, 1969, & 2008 scores on their SAT, the GPA 
                                    score would predict 3.08, 3.11, & 3.69.</font></p>
                                    <p><font size="3.5">From the top 15 scores, a student scoreed 2050 on the SAT and has a GPA of 3.81. If we predict 2008 as an SAT score, then the GPA score is
                                    3.69. The hypothesis is accurate about the higher the SAT score, the higher the GPA. Predicting a 1650 SAT score, the GPA would be lower than a 
                                    higher SAT score.</font></p>
